	\chapter{Preliminaries on differential geometry}
		In this chapter we will introduce the topic of fiber bundles vector bundles and some basic notions that will be used afterwards. Those concepts will be fundamental for the study of Gauge Theories.\\
		In what follows, we will assume that the reader has familiarity with basic notions of smooth manifold and Lie groups. To deepen those concepts, the reader is advised to consult [1] chap. 1,2,3,4, and [2] chap. 1,2.
		\section{Smooth manifolds}
		In this chapter we introduce the notion of smooth manifolds, tangent sopaces and vector fields; with some examples. More details can be found in [1] chap. 1 pag. 48-57.
		\begin{Def}
			A \textit{topological manifold} $M$ of dimension $n$ T2, second countable, locally euclidean topological space of dimension $n$. With locally euclidean we mean that for every point $p\in M$ there exists an open subset $U\subset M$ containing $p$, and an homeomprphism $\phi:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$. The couple $(U,\phi)$ is called \textit{chart}. 
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Ex}
			The space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $(\mathbb{R}^n, id)$ where $id:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is the idenity map, is a topological manifold. 
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Def}
			Two charts $(U_1,\phi:U_1\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $(U_2,\varphi:U_2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n)$ on the same topological manifold $M$ are said to be \textit{compatible} if
			$\phi\circ\varphi^{-1}:\varphi(U_1\cap U_2)\rightarrow \phi(U_1\cap U_2)$ and $\varphi\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi(U_1\cap U_2)\rightarrow \varphi(U_1\cap U_2)$ are $C^\infty$.\\
			A collection of compatible charts $\mathbb{U}=\{(U_i,\phi_{i})\}$ on $M$ such that $M=\bigcup_i U_i$ is called \textit{atlas}. A topological manifold endowed with a maximal atlas is called \textit{smooth manifold}.
		\end{Def}
		It is possible to show that if two charts are compatible with some other charts of a given atlas, then they are also compatible with one another. For more details see (TU????)[1] (pag. 51, cap. 2).
		\begin{Obs}\label{Obs:1.1.1}
			Every open subset of a smooth manifold is still a smooth manifold. In fact if $\{(U_i,\phi_i)\}$ is an atlas for $M$, considering an open set $A\subset M$ the collection $\{(U_i\cap A,\phi_i|_{U_i\cap A})\}$ is an atlas for $A$.
		\end{Obs}
		We now give some important examples of smooth manifolds:
		\begin{Ex}
			The set $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the chart $(\mathbb{R}^n,\phi)$, where $\phi=(r^1,...,r^n)$ and $r^i$ are the standard coordinate of $\mathbb{R}^n$, is a smooth manifold.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Ex} [\textbf{The general linear group}]\label{Ex 1.1}
			The set $GL_n(\mathbb{R})=\{A\in M_{n\times n}|det(A)\neq0\}$ si a smooth manifold. One can see this by considering the map $det:\mathbb{R}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, by definition $GL_n(\mathbb{R})=det^{-1}(\mathbb{R}-\{0\})$. Since the map $det$ is continuous, the pre-images of open sets are open as well, thus $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. By observation \ref{Obs:1.1.1}, $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a smooth manifold.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Ex} [The circle]
			Consider the unit circle $S^1=\{x^2+y^2=1\}\subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Let there be two charts: $$(U_1=\{x^2+y^2=1;y>0\},\phi_1) \, and \,  (U_2=\{x^2+y^2=1;y<0\},\phi_2)$$ like in figure \ref{figura 1}, where the coordinate maps are defined like: $\phi_1(x,y)=x$ e $\phi_2(x,y)=x$.
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\begin{tikzpicture}
					\draw[->] (-2,0) -- (2,0) node[anchor=north west] {$x$};
					\draw[->] (0,-2.) -- (0,2) node[anchor=south east] {$y$};
					\draw[thick] (0,0) circle (1cm);
					\draw (0.4,1.5) node{$U_1$};
					\draw (-0.4,-1.5) node{$U_2$};
					\draw[thick, ->] (0,1)--(0,0.2) ;
					\draw (0.5,0.5) node{$\phi_1$};
					\draw (-0.5,-0.5) node{$\phi_2$};
					\draw[thick, ->] (0,-1)--(0,-0.2);
				\end{tikzpicture}
				\label{figura 1}
				\caption{The two charts $U_1$ and $U_2$ on the unit circle.}
			\end{figure}
			To those charts we add analogously $$(U_3=\{x^2+y^2=1;x>0\},\phi_3)\, and \, (U_4=\{x^2+y^2=1;x<0\},\phi_4)$$ with $\phi_3(x,y)=y$ and $\phi_4(x,y)=y$. by construction, $\phi_i$ is an homeomorphism for every $i$. It remains to show that the charts are compatible.\\
			Consider the composition $\phi_3\circ\phi_2^{-1}$, this is such that: $$(\phi_3\circ\phi_2^{-1})(x)=\phi_3(x,-\sqrt{1-x^2})=-\sqrt{1-x^2}$$ for $x\in ]0,1[$, which is $C^\infty$. The compatibility of the remaining charts follows by an analogous proof. This proves the circle is a smooth manifold.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Def}
			A subset $S\subset M$ of a manifold $M$ is called \textit{regular submanifold} of dimension $k$ if for every $p\in M$ there exists a chart $(U,\phi)$ centered in $p$ such that $U\cap S$ is defined by the vanishing of $n-k$ coordinates.
		\end{Def}
		Thus if $\phi=(x^1,...,x^n)$ is a coordinate map on $M$, then on $U\cap S$ we will have $\phi=(x^1,...,x^k,0,0,...0)$.
		\begin{Ex} [\textbf{$\mathbb{R}^k$ as a regular submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$}]
			Consider the smooth manifold $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the space $\mathbb{R}^k\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ for $k<n$. Consider also the chart $(\mathbb{R}^n,\phi)=(\mathbb{R}^n,r^1,...,r^n)$ centered in $p$. Since $\mathbb{R}^n\cap \mathbb{R}^k=\mathbb{R}^k$ it immediatly follows that $\phi|_{\mathbb{R}^k}=(r^1,...,r^k,0,0,...0)$. This shows that $\mathbb{R}^k$ is a regular submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Obs} \label{Obs:1.1.2}
			In the definition of regular submanifold, the dimension of $S$ can coincide with the one of $M$. In this case $U\cap S=U$. By observation \ref{Obs:1.1.1}, every open subset $S$ of $M$ is a regular smooth submanifold of dimension equal to $M$.
		\end{Obs}
		\section{Differentiable maps}
		In this section we define smooth maps between smooth manifolds and describe some important properties they enjoy. More details can be found in [1] cap. 2 pag. 59-70.
		\begin{Def}
			Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $f:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ a map. Then $f$ is said to be $C^\infty$ in $p\in M$ if there exists a chart $(U,\phi)$ centered in $p$ such that $f\circ \phi^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$.\\
			The map $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is said to be $C^\infty$ on $M$ if it is on every $p\in M$.
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Obs}
			The definition of smoothness we gave does not depend on the choice of the chart. In fact if $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are two charts of $M$ and $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$, then $$f\circ\psi^{-1}=(f\circ\phi^{-1})\circ(\phi\circ\psi^{-1})$$ which is still $C^\infty$.
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Obs}
			If $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is $C^\infty$ then it is continuous. One can in fact write $f=(f\circ\phi^{-1})\circ \phi$ where $\phi$ and $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ are continuous: $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$ and $\phi$ is an homeomprphism. It follows that, by composition of continuous maps, that $f$ is continuous.\\
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Def}
			Let $N$ and $M$ be smooth manifolds of dimensions $n$ and $m$. a continuous map $f:N\rightarrow M$ is said to be $C^\infty$  $p\in N$ if there are two charts $(U,\phi)$ centered in $p\in N$ and $(V,\psi)$ centered in $f(p)\in M$ such that $\psi\circ f\circ \phi$ is $C^\infty$.
		\end{Def}
		The composition has as domain $\phi(f^{-1}(V))\cap U$ subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. $$\psi\circ f\circ \phi:\phi(f^{-1}(V)\cap U)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$$
		The continuity of $f$ is requested to ensure that the pre-image of $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open subset of $N$. It is also possible to show that the composition of $C^\infty$ maps between smooth manifolds is still $C^\infty$. The proof can be found in [1] (pag. 62 cap.2). 
		\begin{Def}
			A map $f:M\rightarrow N$ between two smooth manifolds is called \textit{diffeomorphism} if it is bijective, $C^\infty$ and with a $C^\infty$ inverse.
		\end{Def}
		It is also possible to show that all coordinate maps of any given chart $(U,\phi)$ of a smooth manifold are diffeomorphisms. The proof can be found in [1] pag. 63 cap. 2.
		\section{Tangent space and vector fields}
		In this section we define the tangent space and the vector fields. From now on we will indicate with $M$ a generic smooth manifold of dimension $n$. 
		\begin{Def}
			Consider all couples $(f,U)$, where $U\subset M$ is an open set conaining $p\in M$ and $f:U\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a $C^\infty$ map. We say that $(f,U)$ is in relation with $(g,V)$ if there exists an open set $W\subset U\cap V$ containing $p$, such that $f=g$ when restricted to $W$. We define the \textit{germ} of $f$ in $p$ as the equivalence class of $(f,U)$.
			The set of all germs of $C^\infty$ functions at $p\in M$ is labelled with $C^\infty_p(M)$.
		\end{Def}
		It is not difficult to verify that the so defined relation is an equivalence relation: if $f\sim g$ then obviously $g\sim f$ at $p$. Moreover we clearly have that $f\sim f$ and if $f\sim g$, $g\sim h$, then $f\sim h$ since all of the above functions are equal in a neighbourhood of $p$.\\
		\\
		By generalizing the concept of derivation in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we call \textit{derivation} in $p\in M$ any linear map $D_p:C^\infty_p(M)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ which respects the Leibniz rule 
		$$D_p(fg)=D_p(f)g(p)+f(p)D_p(g)$$
		\begin{Def}
			A derivation in $p\in M$ is called tangent vector in $p$. The set of all tangent vectors in $p$ is called \textit{tangent space} and will be referred to as $T_pM$.
		\end{Def} 
		Let $(U,\phi)$ be a chart of $M$ centered in $p\in M$, we set:
		$${\partial\over \partial x^i}\bigg\rvert_p(f)={\partial\over \partial r^i}\bigg\rvert_{\phi(p)}(f\circ \phi^{-1})$$ where $r^i$ are the coordinates of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This definition makes ${\partial\over \partial x^i}$ a vector field since it follows Leibniz.\\
		\\
		An important result is the following: considering the tangent space $T_pM$ and a chart $(U,\phi)$ centered in $p$, then the vectors $\partial\over \partial x^i$ form a base for $T_pM$. This comes from the fact that the tangent vectors $\partial\over \partial r^i$ are a base for the tangent space in $x_0\in\mathbb{R}^n$, which has the same dimensions as $M$.\\
		Thus, once we choose a chart, a generic tangent vector can be expressed as a linear combination: $$\vec{v}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_i{\partial\over \partial x^i}$$ 
		\begin{Obs} \label{Obs 1.1.3}
			Looking at the open subset $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ of $M_{n\times n}$, by the previous opbservations \ref{Obs:1.1.1} and \ref{Obs:1.1.2}, $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a smooth submanifold of $M_{n\times n}$ and its dimension is $n^2$, equal to the one of $M_{n\times n}$. However, the tangent space at the identity $T_\mathbb{I}M_{n\times n}$ has itself dimension $n^2$. From this, $T_\mathbb{I}GL_n(\mathbb{R})\simeq T_\mathbb{I}M_{n\times n}$.
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Def}
			Given a $C^\infty$ map between smooth manifolds like $F:N\rightarrow M$, we call \textit{differential} of $F$ in a point $p\in N$ the map $dF_p:T_pN\rightarrow T_{F(p)}M$ acting as follows: for any vector $X_p\in T_pN$ and for any map $f\in C_{F(p)}^\infty(M)$, it holds $dF_p(X_p)f=\\X_p(f\circ F)\in\mathbb{R}$.
		\end{Def}
		From the fact that tangent vectors are derivations, it follows that the differential is a derivation as well. It is possible to show that the differential of a composite function follows the \textit{chain rule:} 
		$$d(F\circ G)_p=dF_{G(p)}\circ dG_p$$ 
		For the full proof the reader can look at [1] (pag. 88 cap 3).
		\begin{Ex}
			Let $x^1,...,x^n$ be the coordiantes of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $y^1,...,y^m$ the coordinates of $\mathbb{R}^m$. Let $F:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a $C^\infty$ map and $p\in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then, the differential of $F$ evaluated in $p$ is a map $dF_p:T_p\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow T_{F(p)}\mathbb{R}^m$ such that, given any tangent vector at $p$ like $X_p\in T_p\mathbb{R}^n$ and a map $f\in C_{F(p)}^\infty(\mathbb{R}^m)$, the following relation holds $dF_p(X_p)f=X_p(f\circ F)$.\\
			Recalling that a base for $T_p\mathbb{R}^n$ is made up by the vectors $\{{\partial\over\partial x^i}\}$, taking a vector $X_p\in T_p\mathbb{R}^n$ defined as $X_p={\partial\over \partial x^j}$, we can write $$dF_p\bigg{(}{\partial\over \partial x^j}\bigg{)}=\sum_{k=1}^{m}d_j^k{\partial\over \partial y^k}\bigg{\rvert}_p$$
			The coefficients $d$ can be found by evaluating the following 
			$$dF_p\bigg{(}{\partial\over \partial x^j}\bigg{)}y^i=\sum_{k=1}^{m}d_j^k{\partial\over \partial y^k}\bigg{\rvert}_{F(p)}y^i=d_j^i$$
			Moreover, knowing that, by definition of differential, it holds $dF_p(X_p)f=X_p(f\circ F)$, we can further expand:
			$$dF_p\bigg{(}{\partial\over \partial x^j}\bigg{)}y^i={\partial\over \partial x^j}\bigg{\rvert}_p(y^i\circ F)={\partial F^i\over \partial x^j}(p)=d^i_j$$
			Thus, the matrix which defines the differential of $F$ in a point $p$ is exactly the jacobian matrix of $F$ evaluated at $p$.
		\end{Ex}
		We now define the concept of vector field.
		\begin{Def}
			We call \textit{vector field} on $M$ a map $X$ such taht to any point it associates a vector in the tangent space at that point: $X:p\mapsto X_p$. 
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Obs}
			We saw that a vector can be identified with a map $\vec{v}:f\mapsto\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_i{\partial f\over \partial x^i}$ for a generic point $p$ inside a chart. Then a vector field can also be seen as a map $X:f\mapsto\vec{v}(f)$ such that $X(f)(p)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_i(p){\partial f(p)\over \partial x^i}$
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Def}
			A vector field $X$ on $M$ is said to be \textit{smooth} or $C^\infty$ if for every $f\in C^\infty(M)$, $X(f)$ is $C^\infty$.
			\\
			Equivalently, $X=\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_i{\partial\over \partial x^i}$ is said to be $C^\infty$ if the functions $c_i$ are all $C^\infty$.
			\begin{Def}
				A curve $c_p:]-\epsilon,\epsilon[\rightarrow M$ is said to be an \textit{integral curve} of a vector field $X$ on $M$ passing through $p\in M$ if $c_p(0)=p$ and $c_p'(0)=X_p$.
			\end{Def}
			From the theory of differential equations, given any point $p\in M$ and a vectori field $X$ defined in a neighbourhood of $p$, there always exists a unique integral curve of $X$ passing through $p$. The reader can find more details about this part in [1] pag. 154 cap.3.\\
			\\
			It is useful to define the concept of \textit{flow} of a vector field $X$ as the map $\Phi_X:\mathbb{R}\times M\rightarrow\mathbb{M}$ such taht $\Phi_X(0,p)=p$; $\Phi_X(t,p)=c_p(t)$ is the integral curve of $X$.\\
			\\
			More details on the flux of a vector field can be found in [1] pag. 155, 156 cap. 3.
		\end{Def}
		\subsection{The tangent bundle}
		In this section we introduce the notion of tangent bundle of a smooth manifold.\\
		\\
		Let M be a manifold. At any point $p\in M$ we can construct the tangent space $T_pM\simeq \mathbb{R}^n$. We define the tangent bundle as the disjoint union of all the tangent spaces.
		$$TM=\bigsqcup_{p\in M}T_pM=\bigcup_{p\in M} \{p\}\times T_pM$$
		This set has a natural projection 
		$$\pi:TM\rightarrow M\hbox{ acting like }\pi(p,v_p)=p \hbox{ where }v_p\in T_pM$$.  
		We now endow the tangent bundle with a manifold structure.
		\subsubsection{The topology of the tangent bundle}
		Recall that a smooth manifold has a T2 and second countable topology. The idea is to induce a satisfying topological strucutre on $TM$ by using the one of $M$.\\
		\\
		Let $(U,\phi)$ be a chart on $M$ with $\phi:U\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. Then, any vector in $p\in U$ can be written in local coordiantes: $v_p=v^i_p\partial_i|_p$.\\
		Now we construct the following mapping:
		$$\Phi:TU\rightarrow \phi(U)\times \mathbb{R}^n; \hbox{ like: }
		\Phi(p,v_p)=(x^i_pe_i,v^i_p\partial_i|_p)$$
		This mapping is 1-1 and surjective so it is a bijection inside $U$. Moreover, it is continuous. Thus, it is an homeomorphism.
		\begin{Theo} \label{Theo_1.1}
			The tangent bundle $TM$ has a second countable and Haussdorf topology
		\end{Theo}
		\begin{proof}
			Proving this theorem would take us too far from the main topic of this thesis. The reader can find the complete proof in [1] Chap. 3 pag 132.
		\end{proof}
		\subsubsection{The smooth structure of the tangent bundle}
		In the previus section, Theorem \ref{Theo_1.1} ensures that $TM$ has the topological qualities needed to be a topological manifold. We now need to show that it is locally Euclidean and that it possesses a smooth atlas.
		\begin{Theo}
			$TM$ is a smooth manifold.
		\end{Theo}
		\begin{proof}
			Consider an Atlas $\mathfrak{A}_M=\{U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha\}$ for the manifold $M$. We want to show that the induced collection $\mathfrak{A}_{TM}=\{TU_\alpha,\Phi_\alpha\}$ is an atlas on $TM$, knowing that $TM=\bigcup TU_\alpha$ and $\Phi_\alpha:TU_\alpha\rightarrow U_\alpha\times \mathbb{R}^n$ is the map constructed in the previous section.\\
			\\
			As we have said previously, the maps $\Phi_\alpha$ are homeomorphisms between open sets of $TM$ and $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. This makes $TM$ locally euclidean. It remains to check the compatibility between two overlapping charts.\\
			\\
			Consider two overlapping charts $\Phi_1,\Phi_2$ on $TU_1,TU_2$ open sets of the tangent bundle, with $TU_1\cap TU_2\neq \emptyset$. Then on the two corresponding charts $(U_1,\phi_1)$, $(U_2,\phi_2)$ on $M$, we can express tangent vectors in two different coordiante basis:
			$$v=a^i{\partial\over \partial{x^i}}=b^j{\partial \over \partial y^j}$$
			Clearly at any point:
			$$a^i=b^j{\partial x^i\over\partial y^j} \hbox{ and } b^j=a^i{\partial y^j\over\partial x^i}$$
			Now it only remains to show that the composition $\Phi_1\circ \Phi_2^{-1}$ is a diffeomorphism.\\
			By definition:
			$$\Phi_1\circ \Phi_2^{-1}:\phi_2(U_2\cap U_1)\times \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \phi_1(U_2\cap U_1)\times \mathbb{R}^n$$
			This map, being a composition of heomeomorphisms, is still an homeomorphism. Now, taking a point $p\in U_2\cap U_1$ and a tangent vector $v_p$ we write:
			$$\Phi_1\circ \Phi_2^{-1}(x^i_p,a^i_p)=(y^j_p,b^j_p)$$
			where we have shortened the notation:
			$$(x^i,a^i)=(x^1_p,...,x^n_p,a^1_p,...,a^n_p)$$
			However, we can make the following substitution:
			$$(y^j_p,b^j_p)=\bigg((\phi_2\circ \phi_1^{-1})(\phi_1(p)),a^i_p{\partial y^j\over\partial x^i}\bigg|_p\bigg)=\bigg((\phi_2\circ \phi_1^{-1})(\phi_1(p)),a^i_p{\partial (\phi_2\circ \phi_1^{-1})^j\over\partial r^i}\bigg|_p(\phi_1(p))\bigg)$$
			Due to $\phi_2\circ \phi_1^{-1}$ being a diffeomorphism, $\Phi_1\circ \Phi_2^{-1}$ is also a diffeomorphism.\\
			This completes the proof.
		\end{proof}
		Thus, the Tangent bundle $TM$ of a manifold of dimension $n$ is also a manifold, but of dimension $2n$, with an atlas given by:
		$$\mathfrak{A}_{TM}=\{TU_\alpha,\Phi_\alpha\} \hbox{ where } \Phi_\alpha:TU_\alpha\rightarrow U_\alpha\times \mathbb{R}^n$$
		\section{Topological groups}
		In this section we introduce topological groups, group actions and quotients, with some examples. More information can be found in [1] chap. 1 pag. 66, [4] chap. 5 pag. 35,36,37. 
		\begin{Def}
			We call \textit{group} a set $G$ endowed with a binary operation $\cdot:G\times G\rightarrow G$ called \textit{multiplication} such that it has the following properties:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Associativity: $a\cdot (b\cdot c)=(a\cdot b)\cdot c$ $\forall a,b,c\in G$;
				\item Existence of neutral element: $\exists e\in G$ such that $\forall a\in G$ it holds $a\cdot e=e\cdot a=a$;
				\item Existence of inverse: $\forall a\in G$ $\exists a^{-1}$ such that $a\cdot a^{-1}=a^{-1}\cdot a=e$.
			\end{itemize}
			A group with a commutative multiplication so that $ab= b\cdot a$ for every $a,b\in G$, is called commutative or abelian.
		\end{Def}
		From now on, the multiplication will also be indicated by omitting the symbol $\cdot$ to simplify the notation.
		\begin{Def}
			A \textit{topological group} $G$ is a topologicla space with the group structure, such that the multiplication $\cdot:G\times G\rightarrow G$ and the inversion $i:G\rightarrow G$ defined as $i(g)=g^{-1}$ are botgh continuous.
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Ex}[The real numbers]
			The set $\mathbb{R}$ with the euclidean topology is a topolocial abelian group with the usual sum.
		\end{Ex}
		We now define the concept of group action on a generic set $X$.
		\begin{Def}
			Consider a group $G$ and a set $X$. We say that $G$ \textit{acts} (on the left) on $X$ or that $X$ is a (left) \textit{$G$ set} if there exists a map, called (left) \textit{action} $a:G\times X\rightarrow X$ such that:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 	$a(e,x)=x$ for all $x\in X$;
				\item $a(gh,x)=a(g,a(h,x))$ for all $g,h\in G$ and $x\in X$.
			\end{itemize} 
			If $X$ is also a topological space and the map $x\longmapsto a(g,x)$ is continuous for every $g\in G$, then $X$ is called \textit{$G$ space}.
			We will write $a(g,x)$ also as $g\cdot x$.
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Obs}
			We defined the concept of left action, however we could have also defined in the same way a right action: $b:X\times G\rightarrow X$ such that $b(x,e)=x$ and $b(x,gh)=b(b(x,g),h)$. We can immediatly show that, given a left action, there is an induced right action: in fact: $a:G\times X\rightarrow X$ defined as $(g,x)\longmapsto a(g,x)$, we can build a map $b:X\times G\rightarrow X$ defined as $(x,g)\longmapsto a(g^{-1},x)=b(x,g)$. 
			It is not difficult to show that this new action respects the needed properties:
			$$b(x,e)=a(e,x)=x$$
			In fact $e^{-1}=e$ since $G$ is a group. Recalling that $(gh)^{-1}=h^{-1}g^{-1}$, we have the chain of equalities:
			$$b(x,gh)=a((gh)^{-1},x)=a(h^{-1}g^{-1},x)=$$$$=a(h^{-1},a(g^{-1},x))=a(h^{-1},b(x,g))=b(b(x,g),h)$$
			This shows that the right map $(x,g)\longmapsto a(g^{-1},x)$ is well defined.
		\end{Obs}
		We now define the concepts of orbit and stabilizer of a G set.
		\begin{Def}
			Let $X$ be a $G$ set and $x\in X$. the set $O_x=\{a(g,x); \, \forall g\in G\}$ is called \textit{orbit} of $x\in X$. We define the $\textit{stabilizer}$ of $x\in X$ the set $G_x=\{g\in G|a(g,x)=x\}$. Sometimes we refer to the stabilizer of a point $x$ also with $Stab_x$.
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Obs} \label{Obs: 2.1}
			One can easily verify that two orbits are either equal or disjoint. To see this, take $O_x$ and $O_y$ two orbits, and a point $z\in O_x\cap O_y$, we can write:
			$$z=a(g,x)=a(g',y)$$
			Then $x=a(g^{-1}g',y)$, so the orbits coincide.
			From this it follows that $X$ is a disjoint union of the orbits of its points: $X=\bigsqcup O_x$.
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Def}
			The action of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is called \textit{transitive} if there is just only one orbit. This means that for $x,y\in X$ it exists $g\in G$ such that $x=a(g,y)$.
		\end{Def}
		This thesis will mainly study structures in which groups act on manifolds. We thus give the following definition:
		\begin{Def}
			A manifold $M$ with a Lie group $G$ (left) right-acting on it is called a \textbf{G-manifold}. We also say that a map $f:M\rightarrow N$ between $G-manifolds$ is equivariant if $f(x\cdot g)=f(x)\cdot g$.
		\end{Def}		
		\section{Lie groups}
		In this section we give the definition of Lie groups and subgroups, with some important results. More informations can be found in [1] pag. 164-174 chap. 4.
		\begin{Def}
			A \textit{Lie group} $G$ is a smooth manifold with a group structure, such that the operations $\cdot:G\times G\rightarrow G$ and inversion $i:G\rightarrow G$ are $C^\infty$.
			A \textit{subgroup} $H$ of a Lie group $G$ is a regular submanifold of $G$ which is still a group under the induce operations from $G$.
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Ex}[\textbf{The eneral inear group}] 
			Consider $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$, which was proven to be a smooth manifold. Given the row-column multiplication and the inverse $i$ which associates to a matrix its inverse, those make $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ a group. Those operations can also be shown to be $C^\infty$ and so $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a Lie group. To see the full proof consult [1] chap. 1 pag. 66.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Ex}
			Consider $SL_n(\mathbb{R})=\{A\in M_{n\times n}| det(A)=1\}$. since $SL_n(\mathbb{R})=det^{-1}(1)$ we have that $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a closed subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$. It is also possible to show that ([1] pag. 105 cap. 3, Theorem 9.9) $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a regular submanifold $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ of dimension $n^2-1$. Since the operations of multiplication and inversion are still $C^\infty$ on $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$, we can say that this is a Lie subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$.\\
			\\
			To find more informations on this example the reader can see [1] pag. 105-107, 125, 165 chap. 3 and 4.\\
			\\
			It is possible to show that (indicating with $^+$ the adjoint and with $T$ the transposition):\\\\
			$O_n(\mathbb{R})=\{A\in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\, |\, A^TA=AA^T=\mathbb{I}\};$\\\\
			$SO_n(\mathbb{R})=\{A\in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\, |\, A^TA=AA^T=\mathbb{I};\, det(A)=1\};$\\\\
			$U_n(\mathbb{R})=\{A\in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\, |\, A^+A=AA^+=\mathbb{I}\};$\\\\
			$SU_n(\mathbb{R})=\{A\in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\, |\, A^+A=AA^+=\mathbb{I};\,det(A)=1\};$\\\\
			are all real Lie groups (risp. complessi). 
			For the full proofs the reader is advised to check [5] pag. 41-51 chap. 2.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Def}
			We call \textit{homomorphism between Lie groups} $G$ and $H$ a smooth map $f:G\rightarrow H$ such that $f(gh)=f(g)f(h)$.
		\end{Def}
		We note that an homomorphism between groups sends the identity into the identity. In fact $f(eg)=f(e)f(g)$ ed $f(g)=f(eg)$.\\\\
		We indicate with $l_g:G\rightarrow G$ where $l_g(x)=gx$ is the left multiplication on $G$ Lie group.
		\begin{Obs}
			$l_g$ is $C^\infty$ since it corresponds to the multiplication of a Lie group. Since this has a clear smooth inverse $l_{g^-1}$, it is a diffeomorphism.
		\end{Obs}
		\section{Lie algebras}
		In this section we define Lie lagebras and left invariant vector fields, with some examples. For more details see [1] chap. 4, [5] chap. 2 pag. 46.
		\begin{Def}
			We call \textit{Lie algebra} a vector space $\mathfrak{g}$ endowed with a binary operation called Lie bracket $[,]:\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$ such that it respects:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Skew-symmetry: $[x,y]=-[y,x]$, $\forall x,y\in\mathfrak{g}$;
				\item Jacobi identity: $[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0$, $\forall x,y,z\in \mathfrak{g}$ 
			\end{itemize}
			We call \textit{Lie subalgebra} of $\mathfrak{g}$ a subspace $\mathfrak{h}\subset\mathfrak{g}$ closed with respect to $[,]$.\\
			We define an \textit{homomorphism between lie algebras} as a linear map $f:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}$ such that $f([x,y])=[f(x),f(y)]$ for all $x,y\in\mathfrak{g}$.
		\end{Def}
		In general, we will only consider finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
		\begin{Ex} [\textbf{The real matrix space}]\label{Obs: bracket Mnn}
			Consider $M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ vector space of $n\times n$ matrices on $\mathbb{R}$. We define a bracket in the follwoing way: given $A,B\in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$, $[A,B]\equiv AB-BA$. Clearly, this definition makes $[,]$ bilinear and skew-symmetric. As for the Jacobi identity, it is a straightforward calculation to verify it. This makes $M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ a Lie algebra. 
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Ex}
			Let $V$ be a generic real vector space. If we define $[,]:V\times V\rightarrow V$ like $[x,y]=0$, $V$ clearly becomes a Lie algebra.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Def}
			A vector field $X$ on a Lie group $G$ is called \textit{left invariant} if $dl_g(X)=X$ for all $g\in G$.
		\end{Def}
		A vector field is left invariant if it's translation induced by the left multiplication leaves it invariant: whoch means $dl_g(X_h)=X_{gh}$ for all $g,h\in G$.
		It follows that $X_g=dl_g(X_e)$, this means that a left invariant vector field is completely determined by its value at the identity. It is also possible to show that any left invariant vector field is smooth. ([1] pag. 181 cap.4).
		\section{Lie algebras of Lie groups}
		In this section we define the concept of Lie algebra of a Lie group. We are going to see that it is possible to identify the Lie algebra of any Lie group with it's tangent space at the identity. For more details the reader is advised to see [1] pag 178-182 cap. 4, [6] cap. 1 e [7] parte 1 cap.3.
		\begin{Obs} \label{Obs: 2.2}
			Given a Lie group $G$ and a vector $A\in T_eG$ tangent to the identity, we can define a vector field $X^A:G\rightarrow T_eG$ by setting $X^A_g=dl_g(A)$. This field is left-invariant since $$dl_g(X^A_h)=dl_g(dl_h(X^A_e))=dl_{gh}(X^A_e)=dl_{gh}(A)=X^A_{gh}$$
			We say that $X^A$ is generated by $A\in T_eG$ and call $Lie(G)$ the set of all $X^A$ generated from vectors tangent to the identity of $G$.	
		\end{Obs}
		Given two vector fields $X$ and $Y$, we define their Lie bracket in a point $p$ as:
		$$[X,Y]_pf=(X_pY-Y_pX)f$$
		It is possible to show that if $X$ and $Y$ are smooth vector fields on $M$, then also $[X,Y]$ is smooth on $M$. More details on the proof can be found in [1] pag. 157 cap. 4. The following result also holds:
		\begin{Prop}
			If $X$ and $Y$ are left invariant, then also $[X,Y]$, $cX$ and $X+Y$ are. Moreover, $[X,Y]$ respects the Jacobi identity. Thus, $Lie(G)$ is a Lie algebra.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			Form the linearity of the differential it follows that if $X,Y$ are left-invariant then also their linear combination will be.
			To show the invariance of the Lie bracket instead: consider a point $p\in G$ and a map $f\in C^\infty_p(G)$, we want to show that $dl_g([X,Y])=[X,Y]$.
			By applying the definition of differential we obtain: $$dl_g([X,Y]_p)f=[X,Y]_p(f\circ l_g)=$$$$=X_pY(f\circ l_g)-Y_pX(f\circ l_g)=$$$$=X_p(dl_g(Y)f)-Y_p(dl_g(X)f)=$$
			$$=X_p(Y(f)\circ l_g)-Y_p(X(f)\circ l_g)=$$
			$$=dl_g(X_p)Y(f)-dl_g(Y_p)X(f)=[X,Y]_{gp}f$$ 
			Instead, to show that the Jacobi isentity is satisfied, take a generic function $f\in C^\infty$ on $M$ and evalue:
			$$[X,[Y,Z]]f+[Y,[Z,X]]f+[Z,[X,Y]]f=$$
			$$=[X,YZ-ZY]f+[Y,ZX-XZ]f+[Z,XY-YX]f=$$
			$$=(XYZ-XZY-YZX+ZYX)f+(YZX-YXZ-ZXY+XZY)f+$$$$+(ZXY-ZYX-XYZ+YXZ)f=0$$
		\end{proof}
		From this, $Lie(G)$ is a Lie algebra called \textit{Lie algebra of $G$} and it is referred to as $\mathfrak{g}$.
		\begin{Theo}
			Dato un gruppo di Lie $G$, esiste un isomorfismo tra $Lie(G)$ e $T_eG$, cioè $Lie(G)\cong T_eG$.
		\end{Theo}
		What follows is an hint of demonstration. For more detail see: [5] pag. 51 chap. 2.
		\begin{proof}
			Consider the map $f:X^A\mapsto A$ where $X^A$ is a left-invariant vector field and $A=X^A_e$, which is the tangent vector of $X^A$ at the identity. We want to show that the map $g:A\mapsto X^A$, with $X^A$ generated by $A$, is the inverse of $f$. To prove this it is sufficient to show that, having $A$, $g(A)$ is left-invariant. This holds true due to observation \ref{Obs: 2.2}.
		\end{proof}
		\begin{Obs}\label{Obs: bracket T}
			We can define a product $[,]$ on the tangent space at the identity in the following way: given two vectors $A,B\in T_eG$, we set $[A,B]=[X^A,X^B]_e$, where $X^A$ and $X^B$ are the left-invariant vector fields generated by the choosen vectors. It is possible to prove that $X^{[A,B]}=[X^A,X^B]$. 
			For the full proof see [1] pag. $183$ chap. $4$.
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Ex}
			The smooth manifold $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a Lie group with the operation $+:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ defined as: $(x_1,...,x_n)+(y_1,...,y_n)=(x_1+y_1,...,x_n+y_n)$. The same holds for $\mathbb{C}^n$.
			Considering $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$, the associated Lie algebras are, respectively $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ with trivial brackets $[X,Y]=0$. In $\mathbb{R}^2$ this means asking for the Schwarz lemma to hold: ${\partial\over\partial y}{\partial\over\partial x}f(p)={\partial\over\partial x}{\partial\over\partial y}f(p)$.
		\end{Ex}
		We now give some examples of tangent spaaces to the identity for matrix groups, recalling that we can identify theose spaces with the Lie algebra of the group itself.
		\begin{Ex}
			We call $\mathfrak{gl_n(\mathbb{R})}$ the Lie algebra of $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$.
			By observation \ref{Obs 1.1.3}, we have $T_\mathbb{I}GL_n(\mathbb{R})=T_\mathbb{I}M_{n\times n}=M_{n\times n}$. From this, $$\mathfrak{gl_n(\mathbb{R})}\cong M_{n\times n}= T_\mathbb{I}GL_n(\mathbb{R})$$
			It is also possible to prove that the bracket defined in observation \ref{Obs: bracket Mnn} coincides with th one of observation \ref{Obs: bracket T}.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Ex}
			We call $\mathfrak{sl_n(\mathbb{R})}$ the Lie algebra of $SL_n(\mathbb{R})=\{A\in M_{n\times n}|det(A)=1\}$.
			Consider a curve $\gamma:]-\epsilon,\epsilon[\rightarrow M_{n\times n}$ such that $\gamma(t)=\mathbb{I}+tB+O(t^2)$, it is necessary that $det(\mathbb{I}+tB+O(t^2))=1$. However, $det(\mathbb{I}+tB+O(t^2))=1+tr(B)+O(t^2)$ from which it follows: $$T_\mathbb{I}SL_n(\mathbb{R})\cong \mathfrak{sl_n(\mathbb{R})}=\{A\in M_{n\times n}|trA=0\}$$ 
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Ex}
			Let $GL(V)=\{f:V\rightarrow V|\, \textnormal{$f$\,  is \, linear \, and \, invertible}\}$ where $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space. We indicate with $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ the Lie algebra of $GL(V)$.  Then, having fixed a basse for $V$, we have the identification $GL(V)\cong GL_n(\mathbb{R})$. The tangent space to $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ was proven to be $M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\cong End(V)=\{f:V\rightarrow V|\textnormal{\, $f$\, is \, linear}\}$. From this follows that: 
			$$\mathfrak{gl}(V)\cong T_{id}GL(V)\cong End(V)$$ 
		\end{Ex}
		\section{Fiber Bundles}
		In this section we will introduce fiber and vector bundles and give some important examples.
			\begin{Def}
				Let $M, E$ and $F$ be manifolds. Let $\pi: E\rightarrow M$ be a map such that:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item $\pi$ is smooth and continuous;
					\item given any open set $U\subset M$ we can find a diffeomorphism $\varphi: \pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times F$ called \textit{local trivialization} such that the following diagram commutes:
				\end{itemize}
						\[
				\begin{tikzcd}
					\pi^{-1}(U) \arrow{r}{\varphi} \arrow[swap]{dr}{\pi} & U\times F \arrow{d}{Proj}\\
					& U 
				\end{tikzcd}
				\]
				Where $Proj: U\times F\rightarrow U$ is the standard projection. $Proj(x_M,x_F)=x_M$.\\
				We call $(E,M,\pi,F)$ a \textit{fiber bundle}, $M$ \textit{base space}, $E$ \textit{total space} and $F$ \textit{fiber}.
			\end{Def}
			\begin{Ex}[\textbf{Product Bundle}]\label{Ex_1.1}
				Let $M$, $F$ be manifolds. We will indicate with $p_M$ points in $M$ and with $p_F$ points in $F$.\\ 
				We set $E=M\times F$ and construct a projection in the obvious way: 
				$\pi:M\times F\rightarrow M$ like $\pi(p_M,p_F)=x_M$. This map is obviusly continuous and surjective since it is a projection. Moreover, it is also smooth since given two charts $(U_M,\phi_M:U_M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n)$ on $M$ and $(U_F,\phi_F:U_F\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k)$ on $F$, we have:
				$$\phi_M\circ \pi\circ (\phi_M^{-1}\times \phi_F^{-1}):\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n,\hbox{ }\phi_M\circ \pi\circ (\phi_M^{-1}\times \phi_F^{-1})(x^i_M,x^j_F)=x^i_M$$
				Now it remains to construct local trivializations. Considering any chart on $M$ like $(U_M,\phi_M:U_M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n)$ we set
				$$\varphi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times F$$
				such that $\varphi(p_M,p_F)=(p_M,p_F)$ acts like the identity map. This map is clearly diffeomorphic.
				This gives $M\times F$ the structure of a fiber bundle.
			\end{Ex}
			\begin{Ex}[\textbf{Cilinder}] \label{Ex_1.2}
				An example of the product bundle is the cilinder. It can be constructed as a fiber bundle over the circle $S^1=\{z\in \mathbb{C}|z=e^{i\theta}, \theta\in[0,2\pi]\}$.\\
				We define the cilinder as $C=S^1\times \mathbb{R}$, recalling that both $S^1$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are manifolds. We now repeat the same construction we did in the previous example: we define the projection as: $\pi:C\rightarrow S^1$ that sends $\pi(z,t)\rightarrow z$, where $z\in S^1$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$. By the same arguments as above, this map is smooth and surjective.\\As for the local trivializations, we can take any subset of the circle $U$ and trivialize the bundle with the identity:
				$\varphi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times \mathbb{R}=\mathbb{I}_d$.\\
				In this case the fiber of the cilinder is a line. Intuitively, each point has associated a line and the totality of those lines composes the cilinder.\\

			\section{Vector bundles}
			We now introduce the notion of vector bundles, which will be of great importance. A vector bundle can be thought of as a fiber bundle, but with a vector space as a fiber.
			\begin{Def}\label{Def_5.2}
				Let $E,M$ be manifolds. Let $\pi:E\rightarrow M$ be a smooth and surjective map such that:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item for every $p\in M$, the set $E_p=\pi^{-1}(p)$ is a vector space of dimension $k$;
					\item for every point $p\in M$ there is an open set $U\in M$ containing $p$ and a diffeomorphic fiber-preserving local trivialization $\varphi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow u\times \mathbb{R}^k$ that reduces to a linear isomorphism on each fiber:
					$$\varphi_p:E_p\rightarrow U\times \mathbb{R}^k$$
				\end{itemize}
				We call $(E,M,\pi,\mathbb{R}^k)$ a smooth vector bundle.
			\end{Def}
			\begin{Ex}[\textbf{The tangent bundle}]
				Consider a manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ and it's tangent bundle $TM$ with the induced $2n$-manifold structure from $M$. We have a projection $\pi:TM\rightarrow M$ defined as $\pi(p,v_p)=p$ which is continuous and surjective. 
				\\
				Before constructing the local trivializations, we need to show that this projection is smooth. This is done via charts. Consider a chart $(U,\phi)$ on $M$ and the corresponding $(TU,\Phi:TU\rightarrow \phi(U)\times \mathbb{R}^n)$. Then we can look at the composition:
				$$\phi\circ \pi\circ \Phi^{-1}:\phi(U)\times \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \hbox{ such that }$$ 
				$$\phi(\pi(\Phi^{-1}(x^i,a^i)))=\phi(\pi(p,v_p))=\phi(p)=x^i$$
				This is clearly smooth since $\phi$ and $\Phi$ are. This proves $\pi$ is smooth as well.\\
				\\
				Now we need to construct local trivializations. We wish for a deiffeomorphism $\varphi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times F$ where the fiber at each point is the tangent space $T_pM$. We also wish for this map to reduce, on each fiber, to a linear isomorphism.\\
				Given any chart on $TM$ like $(TU,\Phi)$, we take as our candidate for the local trivialization the map: 
				$$\varphi:(\phi^{-1}\times \mathbb{I}_{\mathbb{R}^n})\circ \Phi:TU\rightarrow U\times \mathbb{R}^n$$
				In particular we have the following succession:
				$$\varphi:TU\xrightarrow{\text{$\Phi$}} \phi(U)\times \mathbb{R}^n\xrightarrow{\text{$\phi^{-1}\times \mathbb{I}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$}}U\times \mathbb{R}^n$$
				This map is clearly an homeomorphism and a diffeomorphism since both the charts on manifolds and the identity are. As for the linear isomorphism reduction, consider the map:
				$\varphi_p$ where we fix the first argument $p$. The induced map is the follwoing:
				$$\varphi_p(v_p)=\varphi(p,v_p)=(p,v^i_p\partial_i|_p)$$
				This is clearly a linear isomorphism between $\mathbb{R}^n$ and itself. This proves that $(TM,M,\pi,\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a smooth vector bundle.
			\end{Ex}
			\begin{Def}\label{Def_5.3}
				A vector bundle is said to be trivial if it is isomorphic to $M\times F$ the product bundle.
			\end{Def}
			It clearly follows that the product bundle is trivial and so it is also called the \textit{trivial bundle}.
			
		
		\section{Sections and frames}
			In this section we introduce the notions of sections and frames of a vector bundle.
		\begin{Def}\label{Def_5.5}
			Let $(E,M,\pi,F)$ be a vector bundle. We say that a map \\$s:U\subset M\rightarrow E$ is a \textit{section} if $\pi\circ s=\mathbb{I}_d$. \\
			We denote the space of all smooth sections $\Gamma(E)$.
			%We say that a section is \textit{global} if it is defined over the entire manifold.
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Ex}
			Consider the tangent bundle $TM$ of a manifold $M$. A section is a map that associates to each point a tangent vector. $s:M\rightarrow TM$. Note that every vector field is a section of the tangent bundle, since it acts in the same way: it takes a point and associates a vector to it. Thus, smooth vector fields are smooth sections of the tangent bundle and vice-versa. We call the space $\Gamma(TM)=\mathfrak{X}(M)$.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Def}\label{Def_5.6}
			Let $(E,M,\pi,F)$ be a vector bundle. We define a \textit{frame} on an open set $U\subset M$ as a collection of sections $\{s_i\}$ such that $\{s_i(p)\}$ form a basis for the fiber $F$ at each $p$. 
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Prop}
			A smooth vector bundle is trivial if and only if it has a smooth frame.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			Let $E$ be trivial. This means there exists a diffeomorphic trivialization $\varphi:E\rightarrow M\times \mathbb{R}^k$. Let now $\{e_i\}$ be a base for $\mathbb{R}^k$. Then, $\{(p,e_i)\}$ forms a base of $\{p\}\times \mathbb{R}^k$.
			\\\\
			Now we check the contrary: suppose we have a smooth frame for $E$, indexed with $\{e_i\}$. This means that every point $e\in E$ can be expressed as a linear combination:
			$$e=a^ie_i$$
			Consider the mapping $\phi:E\rightarrow M\times\mathbb{R}^k$ acting like:
			$$\phi(e)=(\pi(e),a^1,...,a^k)$$
			This has a clear inverse: $\phi^{-1}(\pi(e),a^1,...,a^k)=a^ie_i$.
			It is clear that at each point $p$ this map reduces to a linear isomorphism.
		\end{proof}
		\section{Principal Bundles}
		In this section we define the notion of principal bunldes, look at some properties that they have and make some examples. The interested reader can find more details in [2] chap. 6
		\begin{Def}
			Let $(E,M,\pi,G)$ be a fiber bundle, where $G$ is a Lie group and $M$ and $E$ are manifolds. Let $\pi$ be smooth and the trivializations diffeomorphic; let $G$ be acting on $E$ such that:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $G$ acts on $E$: $Stab(E)=\{e\in G\}$;
				\item Let $U\in M$ be a local trivializing set and $\phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times M$  the corresponding trivialization, then $\phi$ is equivariant: $\phi(x,h)\cdot g=\phi(x,hg)$
			\end{itemize} 
			Then we say that this fiber bundle is a \textit{principal $G$-bundle}.
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Ex}[\textbf{The product bundle}]
			Consider the product bundle as usual, but let $E$ and $M$ be manifolds and $G$ be a Lie group. Then $E=M\times G$. We can give this the fiber bundle structure in the usual way: we first of all define a projection:
			$$\pi:M\times G\rightarrow M\hbox{ like }\pi(x,g)=x$$
			This map is clearly continuous and surjective. Also, it can be shown to be smooth through the use of charts (it is just a matter of substituting coordinates, since both $M$ and $G$ have the structure of a manifold). The local trivializations will just be the identity map, which is clearly diffeomorphic. Now, we need to ask for a $G$ action of $G$ on $M\times G$. But the action is abvious:
			$$(x,g)\cdot h=(x,gh)$$
			Also, the identity map clearly preserves this action in an equivariant way.
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Prop}
			Let $(E,M,\pi,G)$ be a principal $G-$bundle, then $G$ acts transitively on each fiber. Also, for any group $G$, any right-equivariant map is a left translation.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			$G$ acts transitively on $\{p\} \times G$, obviously. Looking at the fiber diffeomorphism $\phi:\pi^{-1}\rightarrow U\times G$, it can be reduced to $\phi_p:E_p\rightarrow \{p\}\times G$, which is equivariant. Thus, on each fiber, $G$ acts transitively.\\
			\\
			As for the second proposition, it is just an easy result of group theory: if $f(gh)=f(g)h$, setting $g=e$ we get: $f(h)=f(e)h=l_{f(e)}h$.
		\end{proof}
		We are now going to construct one of the most important principal bundles: the frame bundle. This is a principal bundle constructed from a opre-existing vector bundle.
		\section{The frame bundle}
		In this section we will introduce the notion of frame manifold of a vector space and of frame bundle of a vector bundle. We will show that the frame manifold is indeed a smooth manifold and then we will explicitly construct the principal bundle structure. For more information the reader is advised to look at: [2] chap. 6 pag. 241-252.
		\subsection{The frame manifold of a vector space}
		\begin{Def}\label{Def_6.5}
			Consider a vector space $V$ of finite dimension. We define the frame manifold $Fr(V)$ as the set made of all ordered bases of $V$. This means that $Fr(V)$ contains all of the possible ways of choosing a base for $V$.
		\end{Def}
		\begin{Obs}
			There is a natural action of the general linear group on $Fr(V)$. The idea is the following: since $Fr(V)$ contains all of the possible basis of $V$, we get that, having choosen a base, we can re-order the elements of it and obtain the same base. We can also linearly combine those elements to obtain another base. Thus, all of the elements of $Fr(V)$ will be reached by matrices in $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$, where $n$ is the dimension of the vector space.\\
			\\
			In particular, identifying an element of $Fr(V)$ with a row vector $\vec{e}=(e_1,...,e_n)$, we have a right-action of the Lie group $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ of the form:
			$$\vec{e}A=(e_1,...,e_n)\begin{pmatrix}
				a_{11}&a_{12}&...&a_{1n}\\
				a_{21}&a_{12}&...&a_{2n}\\
				.     &.     &.   &     \\
				.     &.     &.   &     \\
				a_{n1}&.     &...&a_{nn}\\
			\end{pmatrix}$$
			We also note that the stabilizer of any $\vec{e}\in Fr(V)$ is just $\mathbb{I}_n\in GL(n,\mathbb{R})$, so that the group acts freely on $Fr(V)$. Moreover, the orbit of any element is the whole space: 
			$$O(\vec{e}\in Fr(V))=Fr(V)$$
			This last result is obvious: given any two basis ont can always find one as a linear combination of the other and so the two will be related by a matrix of $GL(n\mathbb{R})$.
			Now, by the orbit-stabilzer theorem, having fixed an element $\vec{e}\in Fr(V)$, we have a bijection:
			$$\phi_{\vec{e}}:{GL(n,\mathbb{R})\over Stab(\vec{e})}=GL(n,\mathbb{R})\rightarrow O(\vec{e})=Fr(V);\hbox{ such that } \phi_{\vec{e}}([A])=\vec{e}A$$
			The idea now is to put a manifold structure on $Fr(V)$ such that the above map becomes a diffeomorphism. Note also that the stabilizer of any element is just the identity group. Thus, not only the image, but also the domain of $\phi_{\vec{e}}$ will be independent of the choiche of $\vec{e}$. \\
			\\
			We now aim at giving $Fr(V)$ a manifold structure. To do this, we first need to show it is a topological manifold and then show that it is also a smooth manifolds.
		\end{Obs}
		\subsection{The topological structure of $Fr(V)$}
		In this subsection we will prove that $Fr(V)$ is a topological manifold. This amounts to show it is T2, second countable and locally euclidean.
		\begin{Theo}
			Given any vector space $V$, $Fr(V)$ is a topological manifold.
		\end{Theo}
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose $dim V=n$. Having fixed any element $\vec{e}\in Fr(V)$, we know that there is a bijection 
			$$\phi_{\vec{e}}:GL(n,\mathbb{R})\rightarrow Fr(V); \hbox{ acting like: }\vec{e}\mapsto\vec{e}A$$
			We use this bijection to induce a topology on $Fr(V)$ from the one of $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. We say that a set $U\in Fr(V)$ is open if and only if $\phi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. This automatically makes the map $\phi_{\vec{e}}$ homeomorphic and endows $Fr(V)$ with the same topological qualities as $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, since $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ is a topological manifold, it is T2 and second countable and thus by this mapping also $Fr(V)$ is.
			It remains to make $Fr(V)$ locally euclidean. Consider any chart $(V,\Phi)$ on $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. This induces a chart on $Fr(V)$ like follows:
			$$(\phi_{\vec{e}}(V),\Phi\circ\phi^{-1}_{\vec{e}})$$
			This completes the proof.
			Note also that if we were to choose any other element of $Fr(V)$ like $\vec{f}=\vec{e}A$, the map would still be still an homeomorphism since:
			$$\phi_{\vec{f}}(B)=\vec{f}B=\vec{e}AB=\phi_{\vec{e}}\circ l_A(B)$$
			And the left translation is a diffeomorphism.
		\end{proof}
		\subsection{The smooth structure of the frame bundle}
		In the previous subsection we showed that the frame manifold of a vector space is a topological manifold. Now we show that it is also a smooth manifold. 
		\begin{Theo}
			Given any vector space $V$, $Fr(V)$ is a smooth manifold.
		\end{Theo}
		\begin{proof}
			In the previous subsection we have endowed $Fr(V)$ with a topological manifold structure. It only remains to show that two arbitrary charts are compatible. Consider two overlapping charts: $(U,\Phi_1\circ\phi^{-1}_{\vec{e}})$ and $(U,\Phi_2\circ\phi^{-1}_{\vec{e}})$ induced from $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. Then we can write explicitly:
			$$\Phi_1\circ\phi^{-1}_{\vec{e}}\circ (\Phi_2\circ\phi^{-1}_{\vec{e}})^{-1}=
			\Phi_1\circ \Phi_2^{-1}$$ 
			This is clearly a diffeomorphism since the maps $\Phi_i$ are.
		\end{proof}
		\subsection{The frame bundle}
		Suppose to have a smooth vector bundle $(E,M,\pi,F)$. Our idea is now to associate to $M$ a smooth principal $GL(n,\mathbb{R})-bundle$. At any point $p\in M$, the fiber $F_p$ is a vector space. Thus, we can construct $Fr(F_p)$ the frame manifold of each fiber. Define the Frame Bundle as the following space:
		$$Fr(E)=\bigsqcup_{p\in M}Fr(F_p)$$
		The disjoint union of the fibers at each point. There is a natural projection that we can use:
		$$\pi_G:Fr(E)\rightarrow M\hbox{ such that } \pi_G(\vec{e_p}\in Fr(F_p))=p$$
		Now we need to find local trivializations. The idea is quite simple but somewhat elaborate.\\
		\\
		Suppose now to have a chart on $Fr(E)$ like $(U_{M},\psi:U_{Fr(E)}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^k)$. Due to the existence of the projection $\pi_G$ we can induce a chart on $M$ by finding the corresponding open set on it $U_M$ and it's map $\phi:U_M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$. We choose as trivializtion the same map we had choosen to trivialize the tangent bundle:
		$$\varphi\equiv(\phi^{-1}\circ \mathbb{I}_{\mathbb{R}^k})\circ \psi: U_{Fr(E)}\xrightarrow{\psi}\phi(U_M)\times\mathbb{R}^k\xrightarrow{\phi^{-1}\times\mathbb{I}_{\mathbb{R}^k}}U_m\times\mathbb{R}^k$$
		This is clearly a diffeomorphism.\\
		\\
		Note that at every point there is an identification of $Fr(E_p)$ with the general lienar group $GL(k,\mathbb{R})$. To make into a principal bundle we need to verify that $GL(k,\mathbb{R})$ acts freely on $Fr(E)$ and that the trivializations are equivariant under the action of the group.\\
		\\
		The action of $GL(k,\mathbb{R})$ on the fiber is just given by the product of matrices and so it is free. In particular, $GL(k,\mathbb{R})$ acts on $Fr(E)$ like this:
		$$(p\in M,\vec{e_p}\in Fr(E_p))\longrightarrow(p,\vec{e_p}A)$$
		This action is evidently free. Moreover, considering the chart $\varphi$, it is equivariant under this action. Thus, we have a principal $GL(k,\mathbb{R})$-bundle $(Fr(E),M,\pi_G,GL(k,\mathbb{R}))$.
		\begin{Obs} [\textbf{An intuition for the frame bundle}]
			The frame bundle is nothing more than the union of all of the frame manifolds of the fibers. Basically, once we have a smooth fiber bundle on $M$, constructing the frame bundle means associating another bundle to $M$. This new bundle will be a principal bundle and at any point the fiber will be $Fr(F)$ the frame manifold of the fiber, which is 1 to 1 with $GL(k,\mathbb{R})$.
		\end{Obs}
\chapter{Connections on vector bundles}
	In this chapter we will introduce connections on vector bundles and the notion of parallel transport. For more details see [2] chap. 3 pag. 95-102, chap. 6 pag. 262-269.
	\section{Connections}
	In this section we will give the definition of a connection on a generic vector bundle and look at some examples and interesting properties. For more details the reader is advised to consult [2] chap. 6 pag. 262-269.
	\begin{Def}\label{Def_5.7}
		Let $(E,M,\pi,F)$ be a vector bundle. We call \textbf{connection} a map $\nabla:\mathfrak{X}(M)\times\Gamma(E)\rightarrow\Gamma(E)$ such that:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\nabla$ is $\mathfrak{F}$-linear in $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ and $\mathbb{R}$ linear in $\Gamma(E)$: $\nabla_{fX}(\lambda s)=\lambda f\nabla_X s$ for $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}, s\in\Gamma(E),\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$;
			\item $\nabla$ respects Leibniz: $\nabla_X (fs)=(Xf)s+f\nabla_X s$.
		\end{itemize}
		If $E=TM$ we say that the connection is affine.
	\end{Def}
	Note that since $X$ is a smooth vector field on $M$, we have that $Xf=df(X)$ is the differential of $f$ applied to $X$.
	\begin{Def}\label{Def_5.8}
		We say that a section $s$ is flat if $\nabla_X s=0$ for every $X\in \mathfrak{X}(M)$.
	\end{Def}
	\begin{Ex}[A connection on $\mathbb{R}^n$]
		Consider the smooth manifold $\mathbb{R}^n$ and it's tangent bundle. Then, a connection will be a map like:
		$$\nabla:\mathfrak{X}(M)\times\mathfrak{X}(M)\rightarrow\mathfrak{X}(M)$$
		We define $\nabla_XY$ to be the directional derivative: if $X_p$ is a vector at $p\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $Y=Y^i\partial_i$ is a vector field, then:
		$$\nabla_XY=(X_pY^i)\partial_i$$
		This is an affine connection.
	\end{Ex}
	\begin{Obs}
		Given any connection $\nabla:\mathfrak{X}(M)\times\Gamma(E)\rightarrow\Gamma(E)$ on a vector bundle $(E,M,\pi,F)$ and a frame $\{e_i\}$ on a set $U\subset M$, we can expand any generic section into a linear combination:
		$$s=h^ie_i$$
		where the maps $h^i:U\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ depend on the points. If we apply the connection to this section we find, by the defining properties:
		$$\nabla_Xs=(Xh^i)e_i+h^i\nabla_Xe_i$$
		The second term must be a section as well, so that $\nabla_Xe_i=\omega^j_i(X)e_j$. We call $\omega^j_i$ connection forms and the \textit{corresponding matrix} $[\omega^j_i]$ \textit{connection matrix}. 
	\end{Obs}
		\begin{Prop}
			If $(E,M,\pi,F)$ is a smooth vector bundle, it is always possible to find a connection on it.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			The proof of this proposition can be found in [2] chap.2 pag. 73.
		\end{proof}
	\section{The pullback bundle}
	In this section we will briefly define the pullback bundle and look at some of its properties. This construction will be useful to construct the notion of parallel transport along a given curve. To see more details the reader is advised to see [2] chap. 4, pag. 177-180.
	\begin{Def}
		Let $(E,M,\pi,F)$ be a vector bundle and $f:N\rightarrow M$ be a smooth map between manifolds. We define the \textit{pullnack bundle} as the set:
		$$f^*E=\{(x_N,x_E)\in N\times E|f(x_N)=\pi(E)\}$$
	\end{Def}
	We can define a projection like: $\pi_N:f^*E\rightarrow N$ in the obvious way: $\pi_f(x_N,x_E)=x_N$. 
	\begin{Prop}
		Given any smooth vector bundle $(E,M,\pi,F)$ and $f:N\rightarrow M$ smooth map between manifolds, then $(f^*E,N,\pi_f,F)$ is a smooth vector bundle.
	\end{Prop}
	\begin{proof}
		The full proof of this proposition can be found at [2] chap.4 pag. 178.
	\end{proof}
	In general, we will denote with $\Gamma(f^*E)$ the space of all smooth sections of this new vector bundle.
	\begin{Ex}[\textbf{Vector fields along a curve}]
		Consider a manifold $M$ and it's tangent bundle $(TM,M,\pi,\mathbb{R}^n)$. Consider then a smooth curve $\gamma:]a,b[\subset \mathbb{R}\rightarrow M$. This curve is a smooth map between manifolds and induces a new vector bundle, namely: $(\gamma^*TM,]a,b[,\pi_\gamma,\mathbb{R}^n)$. If now we look at the sections of this new bundle, they are maps like $s_\gamma:]a,b[\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ which associate to each point of the curve a vector. Thus, smooth sections of this pullback bundle are just smooth vector fields along a curve.
	\end{Ex}
	\section{The parallel transport on vector bundles}
	In this section we are going to define the notion of parallel transportation along a smooth curve on a manifold. We will see that this definition relies strongly on the notion of connection. For more information the reader is advised to see [2] chap. 6 pag. 262-268.
	\begin{Theo}
		Let $(E,M,\pi,F)$ be a smooth vector bundle with a connection $\nabla$ on it. Let $\gamma:]a,b[\rightarrow M$ be a smooth curve on $M$ and consider the pullback bundle $\gamma^*E$ induced by it. Then, there is a unique linear map ${D\over dt}:\Gamma(\gamma^*E)\rightarrow \Gamma(\gamma^*E)$ called \textit{covariant derivative along $\gamma$}, such that:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ${D\over dt}$ is linear;
			\item ${D\over dt}$ satisfies the Leibniz rule;
			\item if $s\in \Gamma(\gamma^*E)$ is induced from a global section $S\in\Gamma(E)$ restricted to $\gamma$, then ${D\over dt}s(t)=\nabla_{\gamma'(t)}S$.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{Theo}
	\begin{proof}
		Suppose that the covariant derivative exists. Then choose an open set with a frame $(U,{e_i})$, where $e_i:M\rightarrow
		E$ are sections. Then, any section along this curve can be expressed as a linear combination of the elements of the base:
		$$s=s^ie_{i,\gamma}$$
		where we have indicated with $e_i,{\gamma}$ the restriction of the frame to the curve. This relation holds for every point $p\in U\cap\gamma$. Now we apply the defining properties of the covariant derivative:
		\begin{equation}\label{Cov_Der}
		{D\over dt}s={ds^i\over dt}e_i+s^i\nabla_{\gamma'(t)}e_i	
		\end{equation}
		This proves that if $D\over dt$ esists is unique. As for the existence, we can define the covariant derivative along a curve $\gamma(t)$ like we did in formula \ref{Cov_Der}. This definition is by uniqueness independent from the choice of the frame choice on $U$. This completes the proof.
	\end{proof}
	\begin{Def}
		We say that a section $s\in\Gamma(\gamma^*E)$ is parallel along $\gamma:]a,b[\rightarrow M$ if ${D\over dt}s=0$ for every $t$. We call $s(b)$ the parallel transport of $s(a)$ along $\gamma$.
	\end{Def}
	\begin{Prop}
		Let $(E,M,\pi,F)$ be a smooth vector bundle and $\gamma:[a,b]\rightarrow M$ a smooth curve. Then there is a unique isomorphism called \textit{parallel transport} of the form $\phi_{a,b}:F_{\gamma(a)}\rightarrow F_{\gamma(b)}$.
	\end{Prop}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\{e_i(a)\}$ be a base for $E_{\gamma(a)}$ and $s=s^ie_{i,\gamma}$ be a section along $\gamma$. Consider the following set of equations:
		$${D\over dt}{s^je_{j,\gamma}}=\dot{s}^je_j+s^j\nabla_{\gamma'(t)}e_j=[\dot{s}^j+s^j\omega^i_j(\gamma'(t))]e_{i,\gamma}=0$$
		This is a system of linear differential equations, which, once fixed an initial condition $s(a)=s^i(a)e_i(a)$, has a unique solution in a neighbourhood of $a$.  This means that, if $]a,b[$ is sufficiently small, there is a unique parallely transported section $s(b)$ along $\gamma$. Using this result and fixing $s^j(a)=1$, we can say that there is a unique vector field for each index $j$, which is parallely transported along $\gamma$ and such that it is a base for $E$ at $\gamma(a)$. This induces a linear mapping:
		$$\phi_{a,b}:E_{\gamma(a)}\rightarrow E_{\gamma(b)}\hbox{ acting like: } s(a)\rightarrow s(b)$$
		From the fact that any section $s(t)$ is parallel along $\gamma(t)$ if and only if $s(-t)$ is parallel along $\gamma(-t)$, we can construct the inverse of this mapping:
		$$\phi^{-1}_{a,b}=\phi_{b,a}$$
		This proves the map is isomorphic.
	\end{proof}
	\begin{Obs}
		Recall that frames are elements of the frame bundle. From the previous result we have basically shown that, given a smooth curve $\gamma$, a connection $\nabla$ on a vector bundle $(E,M,\pi,F)$ and an initial condition $\{e_i(a)\}\in Fr(E_\gamma(a))$, we can always find find a unique element of the frame bundle which is parallely transported along $\gamma$. In SEZIONE SUCCESSIVA we will see that this result will allow us to endow the frame bundle with a canonical notion of horizontality.
	\end{Obs}
	We now look at the notion of parallel transport on the tangent bundle of a manifold.
	\subsection{The parallel transport on the tangeng bundle}
	In this subsection we will use the previous results to study the notion of parallel transport on the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold. More information on this topic can be found in [2] chap.3 pag. 95-102.
	\begin{comment}
		\chapter{Connections on Principal bundles}
		\section{Fundamental vector fields}
		Suppose to have a Lie group $G$ that right-acts smoothly on a manifold $M$. Then, consider any element $A\in\mathfrak{g}$ inside the Lie Algebra of $G$. Define:
		$$\bar{A}={d\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}p\cdot e^{tA}\in T_pM$$
		This, at any point is called \textbf{fundamental vector field associated to $A$}.\\
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{fundamental_vector.pdf}
		\end{center}
		The idea is to take a point $p\in M$ and a curve passing through it like $c_p(t)=p\cdot e^{tA}$. This is a smooth curve and so it can be derived. The fundamental vector field in $p$ is the initial tangent vector of this curve (initial in the sense that for $t=0$ the curve goes through $p$).
		\begin{Prop}
			The fundamentale vector field associated to $A$ is always smooth.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			Non ne ho voglia ma è una cazzata di conti.
		\end{proof}
		There is an alternative mathematical construction for the same concept: define the map $j_p:G\rightarrow M$ like follows:
		$$j_p(g)=p\cdot g$$
		Its differential is defined as:
		$$dj_p(A\in\mathfrak{g})={d\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}j_p(e^{tA})={d\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}p\cdot e^{tA}$$
		\begin{Ex}
			Consider the flat Euclidean manifold $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the Lie group $U(1)$ of complex modulo 1 numbers. The Lie algebra of the group is $\mathfrak{u}(1)={i\theta;\theta\in\mathbb{R}}$ made up of all multiples of $i$. We set the following action of $U(1)$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ given by: $e^{i\theta}(x,y)=(xcos(\theta)-ysin\theta,ycos(\theta)+xsin(\theta))$.
			Then, choosing the point $p=(1,1)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ and the generic element $e^{i\theta}\in U(1)$, we can compute the fundamental vector field in $p$. Consider the curve $c_p(t)=p\times e^{it\theta}$ and the fundamental vector field in $(1,1)$ is given by:
			$$\bar{\theta}={d\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}j_p(e^{it\theta})$$
			To make things more explicit:
			$${d\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}(1,1)\cdot (cos(t\theta))+sin(t\theta)=
			{d\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}(cos(t\theta)-sin(t\theta),cos(t\theta)+sin(t\theta))=(-1,1)\theta$$
		\end{Ex}
		\begin{Prop}
			Let $G$ be a Lie group right-acting smoothly on a manifold $M$ and let $r_g(p)=p\cdot g$ the right translation. For $A\in\mathfrak{g}$, it's fundamental vector field $\bar{A}$ satisfies:
			$$dr_g(\bar{A})=\overline{Ad(g^{-1})(A)}$$
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			Recall that the adjoint representation is given by the differential of the conjugation map:
			$$Ad(g)=dc_g:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g};\hbox{ in particular }Ad(g)(A)=gAg^{-1}$$
			Now, consider $(r_g\circ j_p)(h)=p\cdot hg=p\cdot gg^{-1}hg=p\cdot g c_{g^{-1}}(h)=(j_{pg}\circ c_{g^{-1}})(h)$
			By the chain rule:
			$$dr_g(\bar{A}_p)=dr_gdj_p(A)=dj_{pg}dc_{g^{-1}}(A)=dj_{pg}(Ad(g^{-1})(A))=\overline{Ad(g^{-1})(A_{pg})}$$
		\end{proof}
		This means that the push-forward of the fundamental vector field under the right action "transofrms" under the adjoint representation. Let us make an example to better interiorize this:
		\begin{Ex}
			Consider again the space $\mathbb{R}^2$ acted on by $U(1)$ like the previous example. Then, suppose $A=i\theta$ and $g=e^{iB}$. We saw that the fundamental vector field associated to $(x,y)$ was:
			$$\bar{A}_{x,y}=(-\partial_y,\partial_x)\theta$$
			Now, the push-forward of this vector field under $g$ will be the fundamental vector field of:
			$$Ad(g^{-1})(A)=g^{-1}Ag=e^{-iB}Ae^{iB}$$
			However, $U(1)$ is a commutative group, so that $Ad(g)A=A$. Thus, the push forward of the fundamental vector field is the same fundamental vector field.
		\end{Ex}
		\section{The integral curves of the fundamental vector fields}
		\begin{Prop}
			The curve $c_p(t)=p\cdot e^{tA}$ is the integral curve of the fundamental vector field $\bar{A}$ passing through $p\in M$.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			It suffices to differentiate:
			$$c'_p(t)={d\over dt}\bigg|_{s=0}c_p(t+s)=
			{d\over dt}\bigg|_{s=0}p\cdot e^{tA}e^{sA}=\bar{A}_{pe^{tA}}=
			\bar{A}_{c_p(t)}$$
		\end{proof}
		\begin{Prop}
			The fundamental vector field $\bar{A}$ vanishes at $p$ if and only if $A$ is in the Lie algerba of $Stab(p)$.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			If $\bar{A}_p=0$ it means that the constant map $c_p(t)=p\in M$ is an integral curve of this vecotr field. By the previous proposition, we have the equivalence:
			$p=p\cdot e^{tA}$ from which we see that $A$ must be in the Lie algebra of $Stab(p)$ since $e^{tA}\in Stab(p)$.\\
			\\
			On the contrary, if $A\in Stab(p)$ then we ge that:
			$$\bar{A}_p={d\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}p\cdot e^{tA}=
			{d\over dt}\bigg|_{t=0}p=0$$
		\end{proof}
		\begin{Obs}
			As a corollary of the previous statement we can say that $Ker(dj_p)$ at the identity is the stabilizer $Stab(p)$. This is pretty esay to see and pretty obvious to think about:
			$$Ker dj_p=\{A\in \mathfrak{g}|dj_p(A)=0\}=Stab(p)\hbox{ By the previous result}$$
		\end{Obs}
		\section{The vertical subbundle of the tangent bundle}
		Let $(E,M,\pi,G)$ be a principal $G$-bundle on a manifold $M$. By construction, the projection $\pi:E\rightarrow M$ is smooth, so it can be differentiated. The differential $d\pi_{(p,g)}:T_{(p,g)}E\rightarrow T_{\pi(p,g)}M$ is surjective since the projection is. We now define the \textbf{vertical tangent subspace} $\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}\subset T_{(p,g)}E$ as the Kernel of the differential of the projection:
		$$\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}\equiv Ker(d\pi_{(p,g)})$$
		\begin{Obs}
			Since, by the theorem of dimension, 
			$$dim \bigg(Ker(d\pi_{(p,g)})\bigg)+dim\bigg(Im(d\pi_{(p,g)})\bigg)=dim\bigg(T_{(p,g)}E\bigg)$$
			Moreover, the map $d\pi$ is surjective and so the image corresponds to the full space $T_{\pi(p,g)}M$, we get:
			$$dim \bigg(Ker(d\pi_{(p,g)})\bigg)=dim\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}=dim\bigg(T_{(p,g)}E\bigg)-dim\bigg(T_{\pi_{(p,g)}}M\bigg)=dim G$$
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Prop}
			For every element of $E$, the corresponding fundamental tangent vector is vertical.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			We just need to prove that the fundamental tangent vector is in the Kernel of the differential. Recall that the fundamental vecotr field can be seen as the differential of the map $j_{(p,g)}:G\rightarrow E$ defined as 
			$$j_{(p,g)}(h)=(p,g)\cdot h $$
			Taking now the composition with the projection:
			$$(\pi\circ j_{(p,g)})(h)=\pi((p,g)\cdot h)=\pi(p,g)$$
			This result is independent of the choice of $h\in G$, thus the composition $\pi\circ j_{(p,g)}$ is the constant map and hao it's differential the null map.\\
			Recalling that $\bar{A}_{(p,g)}=dj_{(p,g)}(A)$ we clearly see that:
			$$d\pi_{(p,g)}(\bar{A}_{(p,g)})=
			(d\pi_{(p,g)}\circ dj_{(p,g)})(A)=
			d(\pi\circ j_{(p,g)})(A)=0$$
		\end{proof}
		We can now generalize proposiotion REFERENZA for a principal $G$-bundle:
		\begin{Prop}
			Let $(E,M,\pi,G)$ be a principal $G-$bundle and $(p,g)$ a point in $E$. Then: 
			$$dj_{(p,g),e}:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}$$ is an isomorphism.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			By proposition REFERENZA we know that the Kernel of the differential at the identity is the Stabilizer of $(p,g)$. However, for a principal $G-$bundle, the group acts freely on the manifold $E$ and so the stabilizer is trivial $Stab(p,g))=\{e\}$. Thus, $Ker dj_{(p,g),e}=0$ and the map is injective. By the prpevious propositon REFERENZA the image of the differential lies in the vertical subspace. Moreover, $dim\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}=dim G$ and so the map must be an isomorphism of vector spaces.			
		\end{proof}
		\begin{Obs}
			As a consequence of the last result, all the vertical vectors are the fundamental vectors and all the fundamental vectors are the vertical vectors.\\
			Let $T^a$ be a base for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, then, at any point, by the isomorphism in the previous result, we get that they also form a base of $\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}$ (under the action of the diffeomorphism). This defines the \textbf{Vertical Subbundle} $$\mathcal{V}=\bigsqcup_{(p,g)\in E}\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}$$
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Obs}
			The name "vertical" comes from the definition $\mathcal{V}=Ker(d\pi)$. The basi idea is that, if we take any smooth vector field $X_E\in\mathfrak{X}(E)$, then the differential of the projection $d\pi:TE\rightarrow TM$ induces a new smooth vector field $X_M=d\pi X_E$ on the base space. The "vertical vector fields" are the ones who get annihilated when projected, since they belong to the Ker of $d\pi$. They are not to be though as vertical with respect to $E$, but to $M$.
		\end{Obs}
		\section{The horizontal subbundle}
		We have seen that on a principal $G$-bundle there is a well defined vertical subbundle $\mathcal{V}$ of the tangent bundle $TE$. We say thet there is an \textbf{horizontal distribution} $\mathcal{H}$ if $TE=\mathcal{H}\oplus\mathcal{V}$. This means that for every point $(p,g)\in TE$ we have $T_{(p,g)}E=\mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}\oplus\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}$ with $\mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}\cap\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}=0$.\\
		\\
		In general, there is no canonically defined horizontal distribution on a principal $G$-bundle.

		\section{Connections on principal bundles}
		Let $(E,M,\pi,G)$ be a principal $G$-bundle with a vertical and horizontal distribution, so that $TE=\mathcal{H}\oplus\mathcal{V}$. Let $\nu_{(p,g)}:\mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}\oplus\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}\rightarrow \mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}$ be the standard projection on the vertical subbundle. Obiouvly, if $X_{(p,g)}\in T_{(p,g)}E$ is a vector field on $E$ at a point $(p,g)$, we call $\nu_{(p,g)}(X_{(p,g)})$ its \textbf{vertical component}.
		\begin{Def}\label{Def_6.6}
			We call an \textbf{Ehresmann connection}, or \textbf{connection on a principal bundle} a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form $\omega:TE\rightarrow \mathfrak{g}$ that respects the following properties:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Given any $A\in\mathfrak{g}$ and $(p,g)\in E$ we have $\omega_{(p,g)}(\bar{A}_{(p,g)})=A$;
				\item $(G-equivariance)$ for $g\in G$ we have $r^*_g\omega=Ad(g^{-1})\omega$;
				\item $\omega$ is $C^\infty$.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{Def}
		Now it is just a matter to find a map that satisfies those conditions. A good candidate is the following composition:
		$$\omega_{(p,g)}=dj_{(p,g)}^{-1}\circ \nu:T_{(p,g)}E\xrightarrow{\nu} \mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}\xrightarrow{dj_{(p,g)}}\mathfrak{g}$$
		\begin{Theo}
			If $\mathcal{H}$ is a smooth right-invariant horizontal distribution on a principal $G$-bundle $(E,M,\pi,G)$, then 1-form $\omega_{(p,g)}=dj_{(p,g)}^{-1}\circ \nu$ respects the following properties:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Given any $A\in\mathfrak{g}$ and $(p,g)\in E$ we have $\omega_{(p,g)}(\bar{A}_{(p,g)})=A$;
				\item $(G-equivariance)$ for $g\in G$ we have $r^*_g\omega=Ad(g^{-1})\omega$;
				\item $\omega$ is $C^\infty$.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{Theo}
		\begin{proof}
			Consider any $A\in\mathfrak{g}$. Then its fundamental vector field is in the vertical sub-bundle and so the projection $\nu$ leaves it invariant:
			$$\omega_{(p,g)}(\bar{A}_{(p,g)})=(dj_{(p,g)}^{-1}\circ \nu)(\bar{A}_{(p,g)})=dj_{(p,g)}^{-1}(\bar{A}_{(p,g)})=
			dj_{(p,g)}^{-1}(dj_{(p,g)}(A))=A$$
			This proves the first property.\\
			\\
			As for the second property, we recall that in proposition PROPOSIZIONE we proved that for a fundamental vector field  we have:
			$$dr_g(\bar{A})=\overline{Ad(g^{-1})(A)}$$
			Now, we can directly prove this for fundamental vector fields, since they are the vertical ones and the horizontal ones would be annihilated by the projection $\nu$ contained inside $\omega$. \\
			Recalling that on principal bundles the pullback of a 1 form gives:
			$$r^*_h\circ \omega_{(p,g)}(\overline{X_{(p,g)\cdot h}})=\omega_{(p,g)\cdot h}(dr_h(\overline{X_{(p,g)}}))$$
			We need to prove that:
			$$r^*_h\circ \omega_{(p,g)}(\overline{X_{(p,g)}})=(Adh^{-1})\omega_{(p,g)}(\overline{X_{(p,g)}})$$
			If $X_{(p,g)}\in\mathcal{V}$ is vertical then it will be a fundamental vector field of an element $X\in\mathfrak{g}$ and so by proposition PROPOSIZIONE we get:
			$$\omega_{(p,g)\cdot h}(dr_h(\overline{X_{(p,g)}}))=\omega_{(p,g)\cdot h}\overline{(Ad(h^{-1})(X_{(p,g)\cdot h}))}$$
			Now by the previous property applied 2 times::
			$$\omega_{(p,g)\cdot h}\overline{(Ad(h^{-1})(X_{(p,g)\cdot h}))}=Ad(h^{-1})(X)=Ad(h^{-1})\omega_{(p,g)}(\overline{X_{(p,g)}})$$
			If instead $X_{(p,g)}$ is horizontal then by the invariance horizontal distribution the field $dr X$ will still be horizontal ad so it will be annihilated by $\omega$ since it contains the projection on the vertical subbundle. Thus proving:
			$$r^*_h\circ \omega_{(p,g)}(X_{(p,g)})=(Adh^{-1})\omega_{(p,g)}X_{(p,g)}=0$$
			As for the last property, we need to prove that $\omega$ is smooth in a neighbourhood of an arbitrary point $(p,g)\in E$. Since $E$ is a manifold, we choose a chart $(U_E,\phi_E)$ centered in a point $(p,g)\in E$. Let $\{T^i\}$ be a base of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\{\bar{T^i}\}$ the associated fundamental vectors. Those fundamental vectors are all smooth by proposition PROPOSIZIONE. By the previous isomorphism, those span the whole vertical sub-bundle at any point. Furthermore, since by hypothesis $\mathcal{H}$ is a smooth distribution  of horizontal vectors, there is a base of smooth vector fields $X^i$ in any point that spans the whole space. Thus, since $TE=\mathcal{H}\oplus\mathcal{V}$, we can expand any element of $TE$ as a linear combination:
			$$V=a_i \bar{T^i}+b_iX^i;\hbox{ with } V\in TE, a_i,b_i\in \mathcal{F}$$
			The coefficeints $a_i,b_i$ aare smooth by the previous observations. Now, applying $\omega$, we get that the horizontal components are annihilated:
			$$\omega(a_i \bar{T^i}+b_iX^i)=\omega(a_i \bar{T^i})=a_i T^i$$
		\end{proof}
		Basically an Ehresmann connection arises on a principal bundle if one can find an horizontal smooth right-invariant distribution on it. One simply uses it to construct the 1-form as above.\\
		\\
		There is another equivalent manifestation of a connection: if one can find a smooth $G$-equivariant 1-form that takes value on the lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ such that $\omega(\bar{A})=A$, then one can construce the horizontal distribution. Naively, one defines $$\mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}=Ker(\omega_{(p,g)})$$
		We are going to see later how this second definition is completely equivalent to the first one. In order to achieve this, it is useful to see something about sequences.
		\subsection{Sequences of vector bundles}
		Consider a short exact sequence of vector bundles over a manifold $M$:
		$$0\rightarrow A\xrightarrow{i}B\xrightarrow{j}B\rightarrow C\rightarrow0$$
		We call \textbf{splitting} a map $k:C\rightarrow B$ such that $j\circ K=\mathbb{I}_C$.
		\begin{Theo}
			Let
			$$0\rightarrow A\xrightarrow{i}B\xrightarrow{j}B\rightarrow C\rightarrow0$$
			be a short exact sequence of vector bundles on a manifold $M$. Then there is a $1-1$ correspondence between the following sets:
			$$\{\hbox{subbundles } H\in B;B=i(A)\oplus H\}\longleftrightarrow\{splittings: k:C\rightarrow B\}$$
		\end{Theo}
		\begin{proof}
			Consider NON HO VOGLIA
		\end{proof}
		\subsection{Horizontal sub-bundle and connections}
		\begin{Prop}
			If $\mathcal{H}$ is a smooth right-invariant distribution on a principal $G$-bundle, then $\forall g\in G$, the differential of the right-action $dr_g:TE\rightarrow TE$ commutes with the horizontal and the vertical projection operators.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			The result is pretty obvious. Let $Hor:TE\rightarrow\mathcal{H}$ be the horizontal projection. Since both the horizontal and the vertical distributions are right-invariant, it means that for any $X_{(p,g)}\in TE$ we have $dr_h X_{(p,g)}=dr_h \nu(X_{(p,g)})+dr_hHor(X_{(p,g)})$ and each of the two terms is still vertical/horizontal, so that:
			$$dr_h X_{(p,g)}=dr_h \nu(X_{(p,g)})+dr_hHor(X_{(p,g)})=
			\nu dr_h(X_{(p,g)})+Hordr_h(X_{(p,g)})$$
		\end{proof}
		We are now going to show that given any 1-form $\omega$ with certain oproperties, we can always construct an horizontal distribution. The proof is pretty lenghty.
		\begin{Theo}
			Consider a principal $G$-bundle $(E,M,\pi,G)$ where we can find a smooth $\mathfrak{g}$-valued and $G$-equivariant 1-form on it, such that $\omega(\bar{A})=A$ for every fundamental vector field. Then $Ker(\omega)=\mathcal{H}$ is a smooth right-invariant horizontal distribution on $TE$.
		\end{Theo}
		\begin{proof}
			We need to prove 3 basic properties:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item for every point $(p,g)\in E$, the tangent space of this manifold decomposes as:
				$$TE=\mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}\oplus \mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}$$
				\item $\mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}$ is right-invariant: for every $h\in G$ we have $dr_h \mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}\subset \mathcal{H}_{(p,g)\cdot h}$;
				\item $\mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}$ is a smooth sub-bundle of $TE$.
			\end{itemize}
			There is a short exact sequence of vector spaces for every $(p,g)$:
			$$0\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}\xrightarrow{\mathbb{I}???} T_{(p,g)}E\xrightarrow{\omega_{(p,g)}} \mathfrak{g}\rightarrow0$$
			Furthermore, we have a splitting of this exact sequence: 
			$$dj_{(p,g)}^{-1}:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}$$
			Thus, by proposition PROPOSIZIONE, there is a sequence of isomorphisms:
			$$T_{(p,g)}E\simeq\mathfrak{g}\oplus\mathcal{H}\simeq\mathcal{V}\oplus\mathcal{H}$$
			This proves the first requirement.\\
			\\
			As for the second property, we just evalue with a simple calculation the right-equivariance. Let $X\in\mathcal{H}$:
			$$\omega_{(p,g)\cdot h}(dr_hX_{(p,g)})=Ad(h^{-1})\omega{(p,g)}X_{(p,g)}=0$$
			This means that $\omega$ acting on a right-transalted vector of $\mathcal{H}$ is 0, so that this vector is still in $\mathcal{H}$, thus proving the second property.\\
			\\
			As for the third property NON HO VOGLIA
		\end{proof}
		\subsection{The Horizontal Lift of a vector field}
		Suppose that $\mathcal{H}$ is an horizontal distribution on a principal bundle $(E,M,\pi,G)$. Let $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ be a vector field on $M$. Then for every point $(p,g)\in E$, we have $\mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}=Ker(d\pi_{(p,g)})$ and so we have some induced isomorphisms:
		$${T_{(p,g)}E\over \mathcal{V}_{(p,g)}}\simeq \mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}\simeq T_{\pi(p,g)}M$$
		Note that the horizontal lift is up to a vertical vector field so it is not unique, the equivalence class is. However, we can find a unique vector field lying in $\mathcal{H}$ that is the lift of $X$, which corresponds to the lift with a 0 vertical component.
		Thus, there is a unique horizontal vector $\mathcal{X}_{(p,g)}\in\mathcal{H}_{(p,g)}$ such that:
		$$d\pi(\mathcal{X}_{(p,g)})=X_{\pi(p,g)}\in T_{\pi(p,g)}M$$
		We call this unique vecotr the Horizontal Lift of $X$ to $E$.
		\begin{Obs}
			Basically, when we have a principal $G$-bundle with an horizontal distribution, we see from the previous series of isomorphisms that the tangent space of the base manifold can  be identified with the horizontal tangent space of the principal bundle.\\
			\\
			Note that in our construction we have not assumed smoothness nor right-invariance. We are now going to prove that if $\mathcal{H}$ is smooth and right-invariant so will be the lift. (This is, honestly, pretty useless as a concept since it fucking obvious, yet it is useful to learn how to calculate stuff).
		\end{Obs}
		\begin{Prop}
			Let $(E,M,\pi,G)$ be a principal bundle with a smooth right-invariant horizontal distribution $\mathcal{H}$. Then the horizontal lift $\mathcal{X}$ of any vector field $X\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ is smooth and right-invariant as well.
		\end{Prop}
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose that $p\in M$ and $(p,g)\in\pi^{-1}(p)$. Then we must have by definition of lift: $d\pi(\mathcal{X}_{(p,g)})=X_p$. Suppose now to take any other point of $\pi^{-1}(x)$ like $(p,h)$. Then, we must have, by the cosntruction of the principal bundle, that $(p,h)=dr_{g'}(p,g)=(p,g)\cdot g'$. Recalling that $\pi\circ r_{g'}=\pi$ we have:
			$$d\pi(dr_{g'}\mathcal{X}_{(p,g)})=d\pi\circ dr_{g'}(\mathcal{X}_{(p,g)})=d\pi\mathcal{X}_{(p,g)}=d\pi\mathcal{X}_{(p,h)}$$
			By uniqueness of the horizontal lift, $\mathcal{X}_{(p,g)}=\mathcal{X}_{(p,h)}$ and this proves right-invariance.\\
			\\
			As for the smoothness, we simply choose a trivializing chart on $M$ like $(U,\phi)$ and construct a trivialization 
			$$\varphi_U:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times G$$
			Now we define the vector field:
			$$Z_{(p,g)}=(X_p,0)\in T_{(p,g)}(U\times G)$$
			Clearly $Z$ is a smooth vector field on $U\times G$. Given the projection $\eta:U\times G\rightarrow U$ we have:
			$$d\eta Z_{(p,g)}=X_p$$
			To see this, note that $d\eta:T(U\times G)\rightarrow TU$ and so we get: $d\eta(Z)\in TU$ is a vector field. In particular, by definition of differential, we must have for any $(p,g)\in U\times G$:
			$$d\eta_{(p,g)}(Z_{(p,g)})f=Z_{(p,g)}(f\circ \eta_{(p,g)})$$
			And since $\eta$ projects the points from $U\times G$ to $U$, we get:
			$$d\eta_{(p,g)}(Z_{(p,g)})=X_p$$
			This implies that
			We can also define a smooth vector field on $\pi^{-1}(U)$ like:
			$$Y=d\varphi^{-1}(Z):U\times G \rightarrow T_{\pi^{-1}(U)}E$$
			For the same reason as before, given that $\pi$ is a projection, we must have:
			$$d\pi(Y_{(p,g)})=X_{\pi(p,g)}$$
			We know that the projection $Hor(Y)$ is smooth by hypothesis, If now we decompose $Y_{(p,g)}=\nu(Y_{(p,g)})+Hor(Y_{(p,g)})$ and apply the differential of the projection, recalling that $\mathcal{V}=Ker(d\pi)$, we get:
			$$d\pi(Y_{(p,g)})=d\pi(Hor(Y_{(p,g)}))=Hor(d\pi(Y_{(p,g)}))=X_{\pi(p,g)}$$
			This means that $Hor(Y)$ is the lift of $X$. By uniqueness, $X$ is smooth on $M$.
